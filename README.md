## 📋 Overview

**SmartDoc Sorter** is a full-stack automated document processing solution. It utilizes a custom-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify uploaded document images into business categories (Invoices, Resumes, ID Cards, Contracts) in real-time.

Unlike generic API wrappers, this project features a **proprietary deep learning model** trained from scratch using TensorFlow, demonstrated within a production-ready microservices architecture.

## 🧠 The AI Model

The core of this application is a custom CNN trained on a subset of the **RVL-CDIP** dataset.

* **Framework:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Architecture:** Sequential CNN (3 Convolutional Layers + MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense Dropout, Softmax Output).
* **Input:** Grayscale document images resized to 224x224.
* **Performance:** Achieved ~92% accuracy on the validation set.
* **Training Code:** See `/model_training/train_classifier.ipynb` for the full training pipeline including data augmentation.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

### **Frontend (Angular)**
* Drag-and-drop file upload zone.
* Real-time visualization of the classification confidence (e.g., "Invoice: 98%").
* State management with Signals.

### **Backend (FastAPI)**
* Serves the trained `.h5` model.
* Handles image preprocessing (resizing, normalization) to match model input requirements.
* Exposes a REST API `POST /predict`.

### **DevOps**
* **Docker:** Multi-stage builds for frontend and backend.
* **Nginx:** Reverse proxy configuration.
